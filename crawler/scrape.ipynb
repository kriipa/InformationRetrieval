Lack of access to funds can lead to poor living conditions, limited access to education and health care and a lack of economic opportunities. While the refugee finance gap is particularly acute in low- and middle-income countries, refugees in both advanced and emerging countries are affected due to the lack of regulations and relevant financial products. There is a lack of awareness of the financial needs of refugees among financial institutions. Therefore, we adopt a qualitative research design and propose a conceptual Qard Hassan-based crowdfunding model to reduce the global refugee finance gap. Our conceptual model is unique and can provide greater flexibility and adaptability for refugee finance. The model could be adapted to different contexts and regions. We also make policy contributions, as our proposed crowdfunding model can help to ensure that the funding is provided in a way that is tailored to the specific needs of the refugee community in various locations.', 'authors': [{'name': 'Rashedul Hasan', 'link': 'N/A'}, {'name': 'M.

Findings: The results indicate that Nigerian university students are more likely to participate in the circular plastic economy through a high prominence of soft power features such as increased awareness, inspiration, idea generation, encouragement and capacity building. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is with the sample.

Initially, we investigated the mediation effect of ATB on the relationship between self-congruity and purchase intention. Subsequently, we analyze how financial literacy moderates this mediation process. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a sample of 383 virtual influencers’ fans and applied a partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM) along with robustness tests to test the research hypothesis. The analysis is based on the moderated mediation framework. Findings: The findings are intriguing for several reasons. First, it reveals that only self-image congruence positively affects purchase intention, contrary to existing self-congruity theory literature. The relationship between self-image congruence and purchase intention is a direct relationship with no mediation effect of ATB. Second, ATB fails to mediate the self-congruity effect on purchase intention. Third, financial literacy has a negative relationship with purchase intention, indicating that fans of virtual influencers with higher financial literacy are less likely to purchase virtual influencers’ NFTs due to more critical investment evaluations. We also argue that financial literacy discards the consumption behavior effect from self-congruity variables on purchase intention. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the literature by emphasizing the significance of financial literacy on purchase intention under the self-congruity framework. It also surmises that self-image congruence does matter for the purchase intention of a virtual influencer’s NFT. However, further research could validate findings by studying broader NFT investors, incorporating fandom and impulse buying variables and examining actual NFT purchases against planned behavior. Practical implications: This research is crucial for virtual influencers’ NFT creators, marketers and fans by providing insights for evaluating virtual influencers’ creators’ decision to pursue NFT markets. The findings reveal that the creators of virtual influencers should reconsider pursuing the NFT market, as self-congruity may not be a driving factor. Notably, our findings imply that a virtual influencer’s NFT is significantly different from a virtual influencer's merchandising business. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in extending the self-congruity within the NFT context, investigating how financial literacy moderates the mediation of ATB on the self-congruity-purchase intention relationship. It challenges self-congruity theory by showing that despite fans feeling aligned with virtual influencers, high financial literacy reduces the congruence.\", 'authors': [{'name': 'Rayenda Khresna Brahmana', 'link': 'N/A'}, {'name': 'Maria Kontesa', 'link': 'N/A'}], 'keywords': ['Financial literacy', 'Non-fungible tokens', 'Purchase intention', 'Virtual influencers'], 'subject_areas': ['Information Systems', 'Computer Science Applications', 'Library and Information Sciences']}, {'title': 'Does the corporate governance index matter for company zombification?', 'title_link': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/does-the-corporate-governance-index-matter-for-company-zombificat', 'published_date': '22 Jan 2025', 'abstract': 'Purpose: This study investigates how the quality of corporate governance practices reduces the likelihood of firms becoming Zombie companies. By developing a Corporate Governance Index (CGI) based on 52 criteria from the regulatory framework, the hypothesis is tested that companies with higher CGI scores are less prone to becoming Zombie companies. The study aligns with the agency theory framework, highlighting the significance of effective governance in mitigating financial distress and preventing firms from becoming Zombies. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a sample of 3,051 listed Indonesian firms from 2014 to 2022, excluding financial and utility companies. Data were sourced from the Bursa Indonesia website, focusing on annual reports. Continuous variables were winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles. The analysis involves developing a CGI tailored to the Indonesian context and examining its impact on the likelihood of firms becoming Zombie companies. Endogeneity concerns are addressed to ensure robustness. Post-hoc analyses investigate the roles of political connections and family ownership in the firm’s propensity to become Zombie firms. Findings: The results demonstrate that higher CGI scores are associated with a reduced likelihood of firms becoming Zombie companies, supporting the agency theory. Post-hoc analysis reveals that political connections and family ownership significantly contribute to a firm’s Zombie status. However, the influence of CGI remains crucial regardless of these factors.

Policymakers are encouraged to institutionalize the use of governance indices to evaluate firm performance. The study suggests extending such regulations to non-listed firms and SMEs to prevent the proliferation of Zombie companies. Effective governance practices are crucial for mitigating risks associated with political connections and family ownership.

These elements, fundamental for fostering innovation, are intrinsic components of vibrant entrepreneurial environments within academic institutions. Secondly, the study illuminates features influenced by management, stakeholder engagement, and personalized relationships.

Moreover, the aggregate insider trading in SOEs better predicts future stock market returns than that in non-SOEs.

These business actors are mostly clustered in networked mechanic villages and provide micro-level CE business opportunities. However, their micro-level CE practices and business potentials has not been explored in the literature. This paper addresses this important gap by drawing on Network Theory to show how the network CE practices of these business actors contribute to waste reduction, resource conservation, and CE eco-innovation.

We discuss our contribution in the context of the nuanced characteristics of the micro-level CE practices and business potentials that emerge from the network of these business actors.

Some studies suggest these movies can positively affect student satisfaction, yet many criticize this method as ineffective or lazy. Our study compared two ways of using popular movies – watching them in class versus a flipped approach – for an advanced finance module. We aim to examine the best teaching delivery of watching popular movies in an advanced module. Design/methodology/approach: This study compares two teaching methods during movie screenings: a didactic flipped classroom (Group 01) and in-class viewing (Group 02). The sampling frame was final-year finance students from a public university. It was conducted over two academic years and involved 190 students aged 20–23. These students were split into two groups: G01, with 93 students, and G02, with 97 students. The study focused on the movie “Big Short,” chosen for its relevance to the Fixed-Income Securities course (the advanced module). Findings: Our findings indicate both methods led to high student satisfaction, with no significant difference between in-class viewing and the flipped approach. However, the understanding of the advanced module significantly increased overall. Importantly, using popular movies as flipped material resulted in better student grades compared to in-class viewing. This suggests that while using popular movies is a beneficial teaching method, employing a didactic flipped classroom approach yields superior outcomes for students. Practical implications: This research offers practical insights for instructors, highlighting the value of utilizing popular movies in advanced education. It suggests incorporating movies as learning materials can enhance student satisfaction, particularly when employed within a flipped classroom framework. Importantly, the study reveals that adopting the flipped classroom approach yields superior academic outcomes compared to traditional in-class viewing. Thus, instructors teaching advanced modules should consider integrating popular movies within flipped classrooms to not only enhance student satisfaction but also improve academic performance. Originality/value: Our research investigates popular movies' efficacy, particularly in advanced finance education. While previous studies have explored using movies to enhance student satisfaction, this study investigates it further by comparing two delivery methods: the didactic flipped classroom and traditional in-class viewing. While both methods effectively increase student satisfaction, the didactic flipped classroom significantly improves academic performance. This highlights the innovative potential of the flipped approach in promoting deeper learning and suggests practical implications for instructors seeking to enhance both satisfaction and academic outcomes in advanced courses.\", 'authors': [{'name': 'Rayenda Khresna Brahmana', 'link': 'N/A'}, {'name': 'Josephine Tan Hwang Yau', 'link': 'N/A'}], 'keywords': ['Didactic learning', 'Flipped classroom', 'In-class viewing', 'Popular movies'], 'subject_areas': ['Education']}, {'title': 'Spillovers between hydrogen, nuclear, and AI sectors: The impact of climate policy uncertainty and geopolitical risks', 'title_link': 'https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/spillovers-between-hydrogen-nuclear-and-ai-sectors-the-impact-of-', 'published_date': '26 Mar 2025', 'abstract': 'This study investigates the spillover effects between hydrogen energy, nuclear energy, and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors in the context of the global clean energy transition, with a particular focus on the impact of climate policy uncertainty (CPU) and geopolitical risks (GPR).

Hydrogen energy emerges as a dominant transmitter of shocks, reflecting its sensitivity to regulatory changes and fluctuating demand.

These deficiencies, mean the global financial system continues to invest trillions of dollars annually in environmentally sub-optimal projects. To catalyze the economic transition away from fossil-fuel and plastic configurations to more sustainable ones, sustainability accounting and reporting (SAR) is imperative. However, theoretical contention, pragmatic concerns, and costs stoke strong resistance to SAR. The research used ablative thematic analysis to apply hermeneutic phenomenology. First, it scanned the backdrop to the SAR problem and identified a corpus of recent literature from key associated institutions. The initial interpretation of the texts disentangled SAR’s conflicting threads and generated three themes of ‘climate crisis’ and ‘conservative’ or more ‘radical’ SAR reform paradigms. Iteratively harnessing these thematic lenses, the investigation re-examined the SAR literature corpus. The textual ‘dialogue’ generated understanding of the fragmented SAR responses to the climate crisis. Accordingly, the research reformulated its first theme to ‘dystopic climate crisis fragmentation’ and refined the other themes to take account of materiality and the split between Anglo-Saxon (IFRS, SSAB) or global (UN) and continental European accounting institutions (EU, GRI). Conservatives retain a single materiality investor-focus and concede only incremental standard improvements. Radicals seek to implement double materiality with a broader spectrum of stakeholders in mind. Both approaches have theoretical as well as pragmatic advantages and disadvantages, so the SAR contention rumbles on. Whilst the standard-setting landscape is evolving, disagreements remain. Its roots of contention are philosophical and pragmatic. Philosophically, radicals strive to temper libertarian anarcho-capitalist proclivities and broaden firm responsibility. Pragmatically, social, or environmental externalities are problematic to assign or measure. Given vested interests in the destructive status quo, it would be naïve to expect a harmonious SAR Ithaca to emerge anytime soon.

Using data from January 2012 to June 2024, we conduct a two-stage analysis. In the first stage, we use a TVP-VAR model to analyze market interconnectedness. The results show that over half of the variability in export returns comes from cross-country spillovers, indicating strong global fish trade integration. Japan and Thailand are identified as key shock transmitters, while Chile and China emerge as major receivers. In the second stage, we apply DCC and ADCC-GARCH models to assess the asymmetric effects of CPU on fisheries trade. The results reveal that negative CPU shocks have a significantly stronger impact on market interconnectedness than positive shocks, suggesting that uncertainty and adverse policy shifts exert disproportionate pressure on fisheries markets. Also, the CPU has persistent, long-term effects on fisheries interconnectedness, highlighting the enduring nature of climate-related uncertainty in global trade.

The study finds that, across African countries, the transition to a circular plastic economy has been hampered by the limited uptake of circular products by consumers. In order to accelerate the transition, innovative business models are required to invigorate the ecosystem and simplify the logistics of retailing and distribution systems. The paper proposes a new conceptual framework that explicates the impact of digital innovations in the processes of value creation and value capture across a whole spectrum of circular economy reverse logistics activities: recycling, redistribution, and remanufacture.

Findings: The results reveal a nonlinear relationship between digital transformation and international diversification, intensified by product market competition. Initially, digital transformation positively affects international diversification, but this effect turns negative as competition increases.

Design/methodology/approach: Thomson Reuters ESG database, Compustat and Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) were used to derive a final sample size of 1,572 firms and 11,618 firm-year observations from 2003 to 2022. Fixed-effects regression was used to analyze the data. Findings: It was found that increasing ESG involvement leads to an increase in Z score (i.e. lower financial distress), and this impact was more profound during the COVID-19 period and also when firms' innovativeness increased. However, during the COVID-19 period, increases in capital expenditures weaken the positive effect of ESG on financial distress. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the growing body of literature on the impact of ESG performance on financial distress and the nature of this relationship during times of uncertainty such as COVID-19.

      "Abstract: Access to adequate finance can significantly impact the well-being of refugees. Lack of access to funds can lead to poor living conditions, limited access to education and health care and a lack of economic opportunities. While the refugee finance gap is particularly acute in low- and middle-income countries, refugees in both advanced and emerging countries are affected due to the lack of regulations and relevant financial products. There is a lack of awareness of the financial needs of refugees among financial institutions. Therefore, we adopt a qualitative research design and propose a conceptual Qard Hassan-based crowdfunding model to reduce the global refugee finance gap. Our conceptual model is unique and can provide greater flexibility and adaptability for refugee finance. The model could be adapted to different contexts and regions. We also make policy contributions, as our proposed crowdfunding model can help to ensure that the funding is provided in a way that is tailored to the specific needs of the refugee community in various locations.\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to address the critical subject of building capacity for the circular economy in the global south. It complements the literature by providing information on the role of higher education institutions in developing skills for the circular plastic economy. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a mixed method approach drawing on reflective analysis on qualitative data from 5 focus groups and 12 semi-structured interviews, and structural equation modelling of quantitative data from 151 students across 4 Nigerian Universities. Findings: The results indicate that Nigerian university students are more likely to participate in the circular plastic economy through a high prominence of soft power features such as increased awareness, inspiration, idea generation, encouragement and capacity building. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is with the sample. A larger data set, including other tertiary institutions such as private universities, polytechnics and schools of vocational studies, would strengthen the results. Practical implications: The study underlines the importance of targeted policy interventions and pedagogic innovations to drive awareness and knowledge building among Nigeria’s youth population. Originality/value: This study makes a novel contribution by using empirical evidence to determine the predictors of student participation in the circular plastic economy. This understanding is important for the development and implementation of appropriate policies that promote participation in the circular plastic economy. Furthermore, given the typical youthful age bracket of university students, any plans to achieve a systemic shift in the plastic value chain must involve the young generation.\n",

      "Abstract: This study investigates the return propagation dynamics between cryptocurrencies and emerging market sectoral indices (EMSI), focusing on portfolio impact from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and two gold-backed cryptocurrencies (PAXG and X8X). Using data from 2019 to 2024, we apply a novel DCC-GARCH-based R2decomposed connectedness approach to analyse return connectedness among these high-risk assets. We also utilize innovative concepts such as minimum dynamic pairwise connectedness and minimum R2decomposed connectedness portfolios in our multivariate hedging portfolios. Our findings reveal that total connectedness is time-variant and influenced by economic events. Bitcoin and Ethereum are identified as net transmitters of shocks, while other assets, particularly gold-backed cryptocurrencies, serve as net shock receivers with minimal impact. Moreover, few EMSIs (financials, industrials, and materials sectors) show significant connectedness in the system. Although our suggested portfolio analysis offers improved returns, none consistently outperform the market. This research offers valuable insights for investors and policymakers regarding the interconnectedness and risk management of cryptocurrencies and EMSI.\n",

Using a sample of 180 firms listed on the main board of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange over the period 2013-2018, we identify and measure the extent of corporate misconduct among these firms by creating an index of CSI activity relating to their environmental, social and governance characteristics. We then test the impact of CSI on their cost of equity capital. Our results reveal that higher CSI activities of firms raise their cost of equity financing, although this positive relationship between CSI and the cost of equity capital is shaped by the firms' systematic risks and the institutional environment in which the firms operate.\n",

      "Title Link: https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/does-self-congruity-matter-for-virtual-influencers-non-fungible-t\n",
      "Published Date: 14 Jan 2025\n",
      "Abstract: Purpose: This research aims to examine how financial literacy moderates the mediation of attitude toward virtual influencers’ non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or ATB on the relationship between purchase intention and self-congruity, which includes symbolic representation, self-image congruence and emotional value. Initially, we investigated the mediation effect of ATB on the relationship between self-congruity and purchase intention. Subsequently, we analyze how financial literacy moderates this mediation process. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a sample of 383 virtual influencers’ fans and applied a partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM) along with robustness tests to test the research hypothesis. The analysis is based on the moderated mediation framework. Findings: The findings are intriguing for several reasons. First, it reveals that only self-image congruence positively affects purchase intention, contrary to existing self-congruity theory literature. The relationship between self-image congruence and purchase intention is a direct relationship with no mediation effect of ATB. Second, ATB fails to mediate the self-congruity effect on purchase intention. Third, financial literacy has a negative relationship with purchase intention, indicating that fans of virtual influencers with higher financial literacy are less likely to purchase virtual influencers’ NFTs due to more critical investment evaluations. We also argue that financial literacy discards the consumption behavior effect from self-congruity variables on purchase intention. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the literature by emphasizing the significance of financial literacy on purchase intention under the self-congruity framework. It also surmises that self-image congruence does matter for the purchase intention of a virtual influencer’s NFT. However, further research could validate findings by studying broader NFT investors, incorporating fandom and impulse buying variables and examining actual NFT purchases against planned behavior. Practical implications: This research is crucial for virtual influencers’ NFT creators, marketers and fans by providing insights for evaluating virtual influencers’ creators’ decision to pursue NFT markets. The findings reveal that the creators of virtual influencers should reconsider pursuing the NFT market, as self-congruity may not be a driving factor. Notably, our findings imply that a virtual influencer’s NFT is significantly different from a virtual influencer's merchandising business. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in extending the self-congruity within the NFT context, investigating how financial literacy moderates the mediation of ATB on the self-congruity-purchase intention relationship. It challenges self-congruity theory by showing that despite fans feeling aligned with virtual influencers, high financial literacy reduces the congruence.\n",

      "Published Date: 22 Jan 2025\n",
      "Abstract: Purpose: This study investigates how the quality of corporate governance practices reduces the likelihood of firms becoming Zombie companies. By developing a Corporate Governance Index (CGI) based on 52 criteria from the regulatory framework, the hypothesis is tested that companies with higher CGI scores are less prone to becoming Zombie companies. The study aligns with the agency theory framework, highlighting the significance of effective governance in mitigating financial distress and preventing firms from becoming Zombies. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a sample of 3,051 listed Indonesian firms from 2014 to 2022, excluding financial and utility companies. Data were sourced from the Bursa Indonesia website, focusing on annual reports. Continuous variables were winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles. The analysis involves developing a CGI tailored to the Indonesian context and examining its impact on the likelihood of firms becoming Zombie companies. Endogeneity concerns are addressed to ensure robustness. Post-hoc analyses investigate the roles of political connections and family ownership in the firm’s propensity to become Zombie firms. Findings: The results demonstrate that higher CGI scores are associated with a reduced likelihood of firms becoming Zombie companies, supporting the agency theory. Post-hoc analysis reveals that political connections and family ownership significantly contribute to a firm’s Zombie status. However, the influence of CGI remains crucial regardless of these factors. The findings are consistent with the literature, emphasizing the importance of effective corporate governance in preventing Zombification. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the academic literature by highlighting the importance of using a governance index to assess the impact of governance practices on firm dynamics. It highlights the relevance of corporate governance quality in understanding and mitigating Zombie theory. The research suggests further investigation into the role of CGI in helping companies transition from Zombie status to financial health and exploring the influence of upper-echelon variables on the CGI-Zombieness relationship. Practical implications: From a practical standpoint, the findings advocate for the enhancement of control and monitoring mechanisms in firms, particularly regarding debt risk-taking decisions. Policymakers are encouraged to institutionalize the use of governance indices to evaluate firm performance. The study suggests extending such regulations to non-listed firms and SMEs to prevent the proliferation of Zombie companies. Effective governance practices are crucial for mitigating risks associated with political connections and family ownership. Originality/value: This study provides a fresh perspective on the impact of the Corporate Governance Index on firm Zombieness within the Indonesian context. By tailoring the CGI to the specific regulatory framework, it offers reliable insights into the role of governance quality in preventing firms from becoming Zombies. The study bridges a gap in the literature by linking agency theory with Zombie theory, emphasizing the necessity of effective control and monitoring to avoid financial distress. The research highlights the pivotal role of corporate governance, even in the presence of political connections and family ownership.\n",

Using ESMI’s strength relative to GSMI, we assess how EU policies, financial crises, and cross-country disparities in economic, business, and market conditions influence integration, employing both machine learning and econometric models. The results indicate that ESMI is predominantly influenced by GSMI. Among potential drivers, differences in expected corporate performance across EU member states, i.e., expectation disparity, are the most significant. In contrast, EU-level policies exhibit no or only short-lived effects. Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic appear to increase ESMI through synchronized market reactions. These findings suggest that EU financial integration is heavily shaped by global forces and internal asymmetries, thereby raising questions about the long-term effectiveness of EU integration policies.JEL classifications\n",

It presents an analysis of institutional ambitions, change measurement, ongoing initiatives, and their sustainability. Our study employed semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions of relevant stakeholders (staff and students) from four major Nigerian universities. Findings were categorised into two main dimensions. First, certain essential elements such as the strength of networks, entrepreneurial culture, and modelling good practices were identified as independent of management, constituting the bedrock of successful university entrepreneurial ecosystems. These elements, fundamental for fostering innovation, are intrinsic components of vibrant entrepreneurial environments within academic institutions. Secondly, the study illuminates features influenced by management, stakeholder engagement, and personalized relationships. These elements, encompassing aspects like infrastructure, funding, quality control management, and state-level policies, act as catalysts for development but are not obligatory. They function as path-dependent variables, leading to varying outputs. Despite their variability, these management-driven factors are indispensable for the evolution and scaling of university entrepreneurial ecosystems, forming the backbone of innovation within higher education institutions in Nigeria\n",

      "Abstract: This paper investigates the political determinants of informed insider trading using an international sample of firms from 28 countries. We show that insider trading in state-owned firms (SOEs) is statistically and economically more profitable and informative than in non-state-owned firms, indicating a unique political information advantage enjoyed by these insiders. Further analysis shows that insider trading in government-owned firms becomes more profitable during nationwide periods of political uncertainty and when industry-specific government actions are introduced. Moreover, the aggregate insider trading in SOEs better predicts future stock market returns than that in non-SOEs. These results suggest that the political information advantage of SOE insiders is evident in both the idiosyncratic and macroeconomic information content of insider trading, consistent with the superior ability of these insiders to interpret the economic impact of the country-, industry-, and firm-specific government actions.\n",

      "Abstract: Despite politicians sometimes playing an active agentic role in the outcomes of corporate political activity (CPA), there is limited research on the supply-side dynamics of political markets. Similarly, there is lack of research about the role of normative institutions in CPA outcomes. Using data from over 23,000 firms in 43 African countries and integrating resource dependency and institutional theories, we examine the relationship between managerial regulatory engagement (MRE) - a type of CPA - and access to bank finance, and how this relationship is moderated by country-level religiosity and religion policy regime. The findings show that while the positive impact of MRE on access to bank finance is weakened in countries with high religiosity and more formal religion support, it is weaker in countries with more formal religion restriction. These findings shed light on how firms’ use of CPA to manage resource dependency is affected by the influence of institutional religiosity on the agency of politicians. We offer important theoretical contributions to the literature and generate useful implications for managers and policymakers.\n",

      "Abstract: The circular economy (CE) within the automotive industry has attracted the attention of business leaders, policymakers, and scholars in recognition of the negative impacts of the linear economy of ‘take, make, dispose’. In many developing countries, the absence of manufacturers and their approved service providers means that the automotive CE largely depend on informal micro-level CE business actors. These business actors are mostly clustered in networked mechanic villages and provide micro-level CE business opportunities. However, their micro-level CE practices and business potentials has not been explored in the literature. This paper addresses this important gap by drawing on Network Theory to show how the network CE practices of these business actors contribute to waste reduction, resource conservation, and CE eco-innovation. We also show a missing connection between the CE practices of these business actors and existing network business models that can be exploited for their benefit. We discuss our contribution in the context of the nuanced characteristics of the micro-level CE practices and business potentials that emerge from the network of these business actors. Finally, we recommend that automotive industry CE policies focus on integrating the practices of these informal micro-level CE business actors with macro and meso-level approaches.\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: Interest in using popular movies in higher education has flourished, but determining their actual impact remains tricky. Some studies suggest these movies can positively affect student satisfaction, yet many criticize this method as ineffective or lazy. Our study compared two ways of using popular movies – watching them in class versus a flipped approach – for an advanced finance module. We aim to examine the best teaching delivery of watching popular movies in an advanced module. Design/methodology/approach: This study compares two teaching methods during movie screenings: a didactic flipped classroom (Group 01) and in-class viewing (Group 02). The sampling frame was final-year finance students from a public university. It was conducted over two academic years and involved 190 students aged 20–23. These students were split into two groups: G01, with 93 students, and G02, with 97 students. The study focused on the movie “Big Short,” chosen for its relevance to the Fixed-Income Securities course (the advanced module). Findings: Our findings indicate both methods led to high student satisfaction, with no significant difference between in-class viewing and the flipped approach. However, the understanding of the advanced module significantly increased overall. Importantly, using popular movies as flipped material resulted in better student grades compared to in-class viewing. This suggests that while using popular movies is a beneficial teaching method, employing a didactic flipped classroom approach yields superior outcomes for students. Practical implications: This research offers practical insights for instructors, highlighting the value of utilizing popular movies in advanced education. It suggests incorporating movies as learning materials can enhance student satisfaction, particularly when employed within a flipped classroom framework. Importantly, the study reveals that adopting the flipped classroom approach yields superior academic outcomes compared to traditional in-class viewing. Thus, instructors teaching advanced modules should consider integrating popular movies within flipped classrooms to not only enhance student satisfaction but also improve academic performance. Originality/value: Our research investigates popular movies' efficacy, particularly in advanced finance education. While previous studies have explored using movies to enhance student satisfaction, this study investigates it further by comparing two delivery methods: the didactic flipped classroom and traditional in-class viewing. While both methods effectively increase student satisfaction, the didactic flipped classroom significantly improves academic performance. This highlights the innovative potential of the flipped approach in promoting deeper learning and suggests practical implications for instructors seeking to enhance both satisfaction and academic outcomes in advanced courses.\n",

      "Abstract: This study investigates the spillover effects between hydrogen energy, nuclear energy, and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors in the context of the global clean energy transition, with a particular focus on the impact of climate policy uncertainty (CPU) and geopolitical risks (GPR). Employing the TVP-VAR extended joint connectedness approach, the findings show a high connectedness that indicates significant spillovers among these sectors. Hydrogen energy emerges as a dominant transmitter of shocks, reflecting its sensitivity to regulatory changes and fluctuating demand. However, nuclear energy acts as a stabilising force that offers hedging opportunities and resilience against market turbulence. The AI sector exhibits strong connectedness, primarily as a net receiver of shocks, driven by its dependency on clean energy sources and vulnerability to energy market volatility. Using the GARCH-MIDAS framework, the study identifies a temporal asymmetry in market responses to CPU and GPR. CPU triggers immediate but short-lived disruptions, while GPR induces delayed yet persistent effects that intensify cross-sector spillovers over time. These results underline the vulnerabilities of sectors reliant on regulatory clarity and geopolitical stability. This study provides practical insights for investors, policymakers, technology, and energy companies to better manage systemic risks at the crossroads of clean energy, technological innovation, and uncertainty.\n",

Utilizing data from Chinese CBM&As activities from 2010 to 2018, we find that while relative political risk concerns deter deal completion rate, higher ESG standards of acquirer firms reduce this deterrence effect. The results remain robust to considering ‘duration of deal completion’ as an alternative variable and when splitting the target sample countries into developed and emerging economies. The key conclusion is that emerging market multinational companies can effectively employ ESG as a strategic tool for internationalisation, enabling them to overcome some of the inherent ‘liabilities of origin’.\n",

      "Abstract: Despite the climate crisis, a significant barrier to sustainability is limitations to the current accounting and reporting system. These deficiencies, mean the global financial system continues to invest trillions of dollars annually in environmentally sub-optimal projects. To catalyze the economic transition away from fossil-fuel and plastic configurations to more sustainable ones, sustainability accounting and reporting (SAR) is imperative. However, theoretical contention, pragmatic concerns, and costs stoke strong resistance to SAR. The research used ablative thematic analysis to apply hermeneutic phenomenology. First, it scanned the backdrop to the SAR problem and identified a corpus of recent literature from key associated institutions. The initial interpretation of the texts disentangled SAR’s conflicting threads and generated three themes of ‘climate crisis’ and ‘conservative’ or more ‘radical’ SAR reform paradigms. Iteratively harnessing these thematic lenses, the investigation re-examined the SAR literature corpus. The textual ‘dialogue’ generated understanding of the fragmented SAR responses to the climate crisis. Accordingly, the research reformulated its first theme to ‘dystopic climate crisis fragmentation’ and refined the other themes to take account of materiality and the split between Anglo-Saxon (IFRS, SSAB) or global (UN) and continental European accounting institutions (EU, GRI). Conservatives retain a single materiality investor-focus and concede only incremental standard improvements. Radicals seek to implement double materiality with a broader spectrum of stakeholders in mind. Both approaches have theoretical as well as pragmatic advantages and disadvantages, so the SAR contention rumbles on. Whilst the standard-setting landscape is evolving, disagreements remain. Its roots of contention are philosophical and pragmatic. Philosophically, radicals strive to temper libertarian anarcho-capitalist proclivities and broaden firm responsibility. Pragmatically, social, or environmental externalities are problematic to assign or measure. Given vested interests in the destructive status quo, it would be naïve to expect a harmonious SAR Ithaca to emerge anytime soon. Yet the challenges impel an intensification of SAR dialogue and concrete actions. Rather than a scientifically nomothetic contribution, the paper provides a qualitative, artful interpretation of a complex, contentious but crucial field.\n",

      "Abstract: The main objective of this research is to investigate the fisheries interconnectedness among fish-exporting nations and how the climate policy uncertainty (CPU) may affect that dynamic connectedness. Using data from January 2012 to June 2024, we conduct a two-stage analysis. In the first stage, we use a TVP-VAR model to analyze market interconnectedness. The results show that over half of the variability in export returns comes from cross-country spillovers, indicating strong global fish trade integration. Japan and Thailand are identified as key shock transmitters, while Chile and China emerge as major receivers. In the second stage, we apply DCC and ADCC-GARCH models to assess the asymmetric effects of CPU on fisheries trade. The results reveal that negative CPU shocks have a significantly stronger impact on market interconnectedness than positive shocks, suggesting that uncertainty and adverse policy shifts exert disproportionate pressure on fisheries markets. Also, the CPU has persistent, long-term effects on fisheries interconnectedness, highlighting the enduring nature of climate-related uncertainty in global trade. These findings challenge the “One Ocean Hypothesis,” which has gained attention since COP25 in 2019. This study contributes to the marine economy literature by demonstrating how CPU shapes the relationships among fish-exporting nations. The results have practical implications for policymakers and industry stakeholders, surmising that climate policies in one country can influence fisheries markets worldwide.\n",

Transparent water disclosure not only enhances corporate reputation but also fulfills stakeholders' growing demand for environmental accountability. This study provides empirical evidence that companies' transparent water management enhance their market value, supporting Stakeholder Theory. We also tested the robustness of our findings using sub‐sampling, alternative measurements, and address potential endogeneity issues. Our study uniquely focuses on the specific impact of water disclosure, contrasting previous research on overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure.

Therefore, this review aimed to provide an updated summary of the literature on carbon disclosure. A total of 278 articles were selected from the Scopus database, covering the period from 2004 to 2024. Co-author and co-word analyses were conducted using VOSViewer and Bibliometrix R-Packages. The review successfully identified the most relevant authors, sources, countries, and affiliations related to carbon disclosure. It also analyzed the intellectual structure, influential journal, thematic evolution, trend topics, and selective data sources, as well as theoretical foundations in the field. Several investigations have focused on evaluating some aspects of disclosure such as its quantity and quality, determinants, as well as beneficial effects. The current review identified the most relevant topics for future surveys, including companies governance and greenwashing. Additionally, it contributed to the existing body of empirical literature by providing an updated summary and addressing the gaps and limitations in previous investigations, particularly in methodology, data acquisition, and review methods.\n",

      "Abstract: Tree-based machine learning models are crucial for identifying key features of company zombification, which remain underexplored in current literature focused solely on determinants. This study addresses this gap by employing machine learning feature analysis to identify and analyze the critical factors driving zombification, offering a fresh and data-driven perspective on the issue. Three different feature sets are examined: (i) Feature Zoo, (ii) Logistic regression-based, and (iii) Lasso-based features, focusing on critical internal characteristics of firms. These feature sets are applied to four tree-based algorithms—Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Model, and XGBoost—chosen for their white model capabilities, allowing the feature extractions. The results indicate that Debt and ROA consistently have the highest feature scores, suggesting they are crucial for predicting zombie companies. Additionally, the Lasso-based feature sets provide the best evaluation metrics, indicating that the two-step filtering process effectively improves the predictive model for zombie companies. The study enriches the literature by extending the anatomy of zombie companies with a more advanced approach. The results also address Debt and ROA as the most significant features for identifying zombie firms. Managers and policymakers should prioritize monitoring Debt and ROA as early warning indicators for company zombification.\n",

      "Abstract: In light of the Conference of Parties 26, carbon information reporting has become ever-increasingly important. Prior studies presented much evidence on whether environmental disclosure could reliably reflect environmental performance. However, very limited evidence has been provided on if environmental disclosure could drive firms to improve future environmental performance. Based on the competing theoretical predictions from the legitimacy theory and the “outside-in” management perspectives, this study provides new international insight into if carbon disclosure improvements could motivate future carbon performance improvement based on a change analysis. Particularly, the investigation uses a recently available carbon data set of both developed economies and developing economies from the Carbon Disclosure Project and other publicly available media platforms. We find that an improvement in carbon disclosure indicates a future carbon performance deterioration in developed economies, however, carbon disclosure changes are not related to future carbon performance changes in developing economies when using performance data from the Carbon Disclosure Project. When using performance data from other publicly available media platforms, carbon disclosure changes are not related to future carbon performance changes at all internationally. This indicates that the carbon information disclosed on other public media platforms has been intentionally beautified. Thus, firms' carbon performance changes from these platforms lose track of the prior changes in firms' carbon disclosure.\n",

However, there is a need to theorise the process by which extreme work has been legitimised and embedded among professionals. In this paper, we view extreme workers as those professionals who contribute to their works beyond acceptable contractual obligations, either voluntarily for personal rewards or involuntarily due to the menace of penalty, or both. We chose to investigate how accounting professionals in India legitimise extreme work in their workplaces using exploratory qualitative research methods and applied economies of worth theoretical framework. Our findings demonstrate that senior accounting professionals with the assistance of professional associations can play an important role in mobilising professional and organisational resources to tackle extreme work in their accounting firms and the industry.\n",

      "Abstract: The International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF) adopted the Santiago Principles to foster good governance, accountability, and transparency practices. The origins, objectives, market impacts, financial performance, and investment strategies of SWFs have dominated scholarly discourse. A still unsolved question is how and to what extent SWFs implement governance practices. We analyse the governance self-assessment reports of the three SWFs that are signatories to the Santiago Principles and belong to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). That is, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. As SWFs grow in size and number, deepened coordination with domestic fiscal and monetary authorities will be needed. We also find that the Santiago Principles’ economic and financial targeting objective appears indifferent to the environmental and social impacts that have the potential to affect the stability of financial markets. The variation in levels of disclosure across SWFs threatens to dilute the essence of the Santiago Principles badge. Fifteen years after their formulation, the Santiago Principles show signs of needing an update to reflect emerging realities and expanded member contexts.\n",

      "Abstract: This book advocates for a transformative shift in economics, emphasising the need to manage finite resources equitably while safeguarding universal well-being. It introduces the Equitable Optimality economic theory, departing from materialistic views and championing a theory deeply rooted in moral economy, values, and ethics. By integrating spirituality, social justice, and ethics into economic analysis, this model contends that economics can serve the welfare of all, offering a unique lens for economic theory and policy. It challenges prevailing materialistic economic paradigms by proposing an interest-balanced/free financial economy.This economic theory prioritises profit-sharing, societal objectives, and equitable resource allocation, aiming to create a more inclusive society. However, practical implementation and comprehensive research are crucial for understanding its impact and overcoming transitional challenges.The Equitable Optimality economic theory provides a valuable perspective within economics, focusing on ethical foundations, acknowledging non-monetary values, and humanising economic agents. It does not aim to replace conventional economic theories but offers an alternative framework to inspire innovative approaches to economic models and policymaking. Its broader policy perspective aims to foster a more prosperous and harmonious society by integrating ethical considerations, equity and justice into economic decision-making and emphasising societal welfare.\n",

      "Abstract: Plastic waste poses a significant challenge to achieving sustainable production and consumption of resources, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where effective governance and waste management systems are lacking. In this paper, we develop an empirical understanding of the influence of public governance system on promoting circular economy (CE) for plastic actions among individuals. Through a survey of 1475 participants across five sub-Saharan African countries, we tested five hypotheses drawing on New Governance Theory and CE Action Recipe to explore the relationship between governance and individual's actions supporting CE for plastic. We found that a governance system that supports CE practices and exhibits governance efficiency is positively associated with individuals' actions supporting CE for plastic. The awareness of government policies, laws and regulations, institutions, processes, and programmes have a significant impact on individuals' engagement in plastic circularity practices. The paper's theoretical and governance implications highlight the relevance of public governance in shaping action towards a CE for plastic at the individual level.\n",

      "Abstract: We examine the association between the origin of chief executive officer (CEO) succession (i.e., promoting a CEO from within the firm as opposed to recruiting from outside) and annual reports readability. Based on a sample of large U.S. companies during the period 2004–2020, we predict and find that companies with insider CEOs issue more readable 10-K reports compared to those who hire from outside. This positive association between insider CEOs and readability isless pronounced for insider CEOs who wield greater power. We further document that the association is stronger if CEOs have a financial background. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we test whether the association is driven by earnings management or firms’ business strategies. Our results show that the effect of CEO succession origin on readability is primarily attributable tobusiness strategies. We address endogeneity issues and check the robustness of our results in several ways. Finally, we document important policy implications emerging from our study.\n",

      "Abstract: PurposeThis study seeks to understand how accountant stereotypes have been constructed and reconstructed at the macro-national and the structural level in Chinese society.Design/methodology/approachThis qualitative investigation into China's social construction of accountant stereotypes employs Becker's (1963) labelling theory. Viewing stereotyping as a socially constructed practice, this study draws on a post-positivistic, reflexive epistemology in conducting 28 semi-structured interviews with accountants and related actors.FindingsChinese accountant stereotypes are constructed and reconstructed according to the rules created and enforced in different cultural-political periods. The accountant stereotypes constructed during the ancient Confucian period (500 BC – 1948) were replaced during 1949 and 2012 when the political focus shifted towards propagating socialism and later promoting economic growth. They also show how Confucian stereotypes of accountants resurfaced in 2013 but were reconstructed by the central government's cultural confidence policy of propagating Confucianism.Originality/valueEmpirically, prior literature has focused on what the accountant stereotype is and how accountants respond to such stereotypes, but it has neglected the ways in which these accountant stereotypes are politically and culturally constructed, diffused and legitimated. This paper fills in the gap by understanding the social practice of accountant stereotyping in a previously unexplored political-cultural context, namely Chinese society. In theoretical terms, by offering the first use of Becker's (1963) labelling theory in the accounting literature, it furthermore enhances our understanding of how accountants' identities and social standing are shaped by social rules.\n",

      "Abstract: Using a large panel of UK public firms, we examine the relationship between the financial risk hedging and the cost of equity capital. We hypothesize that firms utilizing financial derivative instruments reduce the stock return volatility which is priced in investors’ expectations. While financial risk hedging serves as a vehicle for firms to alleviate cash flows volatility, it also leads to economic benefits to the firm value in case of the presence of increasing asymmetric information. In addition, we hypothesize and test whether the nature of relation between financial risk hedging and cost of equity capital varies and is more negative or more ambiguous with economic shocks. Our results show that engaging in financial risk hedging enables firms to have a lower cost of capital. Consistent with the extant literature, we control for potential endogeneity problems and sample selection bias using instrumental variables and treatment effects approaches. Thus, our results are robust to a battery of sensitivity checks, including the use of multiple estimation methods and alternative proxies of cost of equity measures. Overall, our findings suggest that the value of financial hedging decisions increases during economic shocks, and if financial constraints become more severe and if cash flows volatility increases.\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: The study analyzes the influence of corporate governance and ownership concentration levels on the cost of equity. Further, the authors extend the literature by investigating the moderating effect of ownership concentration levels (i.e. at 5%, 10% and 20%) on the relationship between corporate governance and the cost of equity. Design/methodology/approach: The study applies several robust panel regression techniques to a sample of 114 active non-financial companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange from 2011 to 2016. Corporate governance was measured through a unique index comprising 30 governance attributes. The cost of equity was measured through the capital asset pricing model. Further, the authors construct three variables for ownership concentration levels, i.e. at 5%, 10% and 20%. To address the endogeneity problem, the one-lagged variable model and GMM approaches were also applied. Findings: The results indicate that better corporate governance reduces the cost of equity, while ownership concentration at high thresholds would increase the cost of equity. Further, the authors find that ownership concentration at the 20% threshold moderates the relationship between corporate governance and the cost of equity. Thus, the authors argue that firms can minimize the risk faced by shareholders by implementing substantive corporate governance mechanisms. In addition, effective corporate governance mechanisms at high ownership concentration levels are imperative for managing the cost of equity. Originality/value: The study reports novel evidence that ownership concentration at a high threshold moderates the effect of corporate governance on the cost of equity.\n",

Using a very extensive dataset with 160 countries over 20 years and generating 3,200 country-year observations, this study examines the impact of ISAs adoption on the economic consequences of adopting countries. Our findings are threefold. First, we show that early ISAs adoption has positively and significantly influenced three economic indicators of the adopting countries: (i) economic growth, (ii) foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, and (iii) exchange rate. Second, our results show that late ISAs adoption has positively and significantly influenced two economic indicators: (i) exports and (ii) interest rates, but negatively with imports. Third, we find a significant positive association between ISAs adoption with amendments or translation and two economic indicators: (i) FDI and (ii) exchange rate, but negative with inflation. Finally, and by contrast, we find a negative link between early ISAs adoption, economic growth rate, and exports. Our findings have implications for theory and practice.\n",

      "Abstract: In recognition of the need for an economic logic that complements and reinforces the ecological imperative for the circular plastic economy, this paper explores the importance and impact of digitally enabled circular plastic business models across retailing and distribution systems. The paper draws from 16 focus group discussions, complemented by 17 semi-structured interviews of frontline organisations incorporating digital innovations in their businesses to enable the management of plastic waste in Africa. The study finds that, across African countries, the transition to a circular plastic economy has been hampered by the limited uptake of circular products by consumers. In order to accelerate the transition, innovative business models are required to invigorate the ecosystem and simplify the logistics of retailing and distribution systems. The paper proposes a new conceptual framework that explicates the impact of digital innovations in the processes of value creation and value capture across a whole spectrum of circular economy reverse logistics activities: recycling, redistribution, and remanufacture. The study also highlights two important social and policy implications of digitally-enabled circular business models: Firstly, the creation of new employment opportunities through the empowerment of a new labour force for the circular plastic economy; secondly, the heightened opportunity to enact an innovative sharing economy in typically resource-constrained contexts in which otherwise idle products and resources are more efficiently used in a process of collaborative consumption.\n",

      "Abstract: This paper investigates whether CEO–board age similarity has an impact on firms’ earnings management in M&A contexts. We argue that CEO–board age similarity may have an impact on earnings management through two main roles of the board in M&A, i.e., monitoring and advising roles. On the one hand, board–CEO age similarity may improve the quality of the board’s advice on M&A and thus reduce the CEO’s need to manipulate earnings. On the other hand, board–CEO age similarity may trigger friendship, therefore weaken the monitoring function of the board. Using the sample of all share-financed M&A deals in the UK from 2001 to 2018, we find a lower level of earnings management in firms with higher board–CEO age similarity. The evidence thus highlights the importance of the advisory role of the board in M&A. Our findings have an important contribution to the corporate governance literature and also have implications for practice.\n",

The digital orientation was evaluated using Python-based text analysis. Surprisingly, our findings challenge conventional wisdom: Contrary to expectations, digital orientation exhibited no significant influence on firm performance metrics such as returns on assets, returns on equity and Tobin’s Q. This contradicts organizational orientation theory, suggesting that transitioning towards digitalization might not inherently enhance performance.

      "Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to investigate the impact of product market competition on the relationship between firm digital transformation and international diversification. It aims to uncover how competition moderates this relationship and to reveal the nonlinear dynamics between digital transformation and international diversification in strategic decision-making processes. Design/methodology/approach: Using a panel logistic regression analysis, this study examines data from 235 Malaysian nonfinancial listed companies from 2012 to 2019. The analysis focuses on the manufacturing and technology industries due to the availability of digital transformation data, leading to a data set of 1,180 year-firm observations. Findings: The results reveal a nonlinear relationship between digital transformation and international diversification, intensified by product market competition. Initially, digital transformation positively affects international diversification, but this effect turns negative as competition increases. Robustness checks validate these findings, indicating that competition’s impact varies with the level of digital transformation. Research limitations/implications: This study’s findings are based on text analysis as a proxy for digital transformation, which may not fully capture organizational changes. Future research could use reported transformation costs or mandatory disclosures. In addition, this study focuses solely on international diversification, excluding other forms of diversification and financial constraints. Practical implications: Policymakers should recognize that high product market competition can negate the benefits of digital transformation on internationalization. They need to balance promoting digital transformation with addressing competitive challenges. Managers should analyze the competitive landscape before pursuing international expansion, as high competition can diminish the advantages of digital transformation. Originality/value: This research enriches agency and resource-based view theories by revealing the complex dynamics between digital transformation, competition and international diversification. It introduces a parabolic relationship between competition and diversification, challenging traditional assumptions and providing a comprehensive framework for understanding strategic decisions in competitive environments.\n",

We use robust OLS regression and two-stage least square to estimate our model, and reveal three essential findings. First, loan inclusive (the individuals with traditional loan access) has lower Fintech P2P credit than the loan exclusive (those without traditional loan access). Second, information-seeking behavior would lower the Fintech P2P credit ratio. Lastly, information-seeking significantly moderates the relationship between loan inclusion and loans from Fintech P2P lending.

This paper draws on a panel of business enterprises operating in 33 industries in Japan to examine how research and development (R&D) activities affect employment. Our findings suggest that employment gains are associated with innovation, both at the aggregate level and within groups of major industries. The positive impact of technological advancement is more pronounced in the manufacturing sector. The results reveal heterogeneous patterns of the key determinants of employment growth based on the level of industries' routine intensity, but they accord well with the compensation theory concerning the connection between innovation and job creation. These results will be of interest for policymakers to design targeted economic strategies by supporting technological development in Japan and could also serve as a compass for other countries with similar workforce structures and macroeconomic characteristics.\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: This paper examines the impact of sharia-compliant debt financing on stock price crash risk. Unlike those previous studies that took Sukuk or sharia-compliant firms, this study tests the impact of the proportion reported sharia-compliant debt financing in the balance sheet on the risk of price crash of a firm. Design/methodology/approach: Using the data from 2,752 firm-year observations of 344 Malaysian non-financial listed companies from 2012 to 2019, this article used a robust panel data estimation technique for statistical inferences. This study also employs panel GMM and quantile least squares as the robustness check. Findings: This study established a negative relationship between sharia-compliant debt financing and stock price crash risk. The robustness checks with different estimation techniques confirm the results. It implies that firms with a more significant proportion of Sharia-compliant financing tend to have lower future stock price crash risk. Practical implications: Consistent with the Islamic finance literature, the present study contributes to the existing literature on Islamic capital markets from the perspective of stock price crash risk because it is vital for risk management and investment decision-making as a measure of tail risk for stocks. The findings of this research will assist investors in developing portfolio strategies that incorporate firms with higher levels of sharia-compliant debt financing in their balance sheets. Additionally, the results of this study suggest that policymakers and regulatory bodies should consider revising their monitoring approaches for publicly listed firms. Originality/value: This study is interesting and unique, as it is a pioneer in testing the impact of sharia-compliant debt financing on reducing stock price crash risk.\n",

      "Abstract: This study investigates short-term fluctuations in the CEO effect, measured as the proportion of variance in firm performance attributable to individual CEOs, in response to macroeconomic crises, with a specific focus on the global financial crisis. Utilizing multilevel modeling on a 15-year dataset of US firms and assessing three performance metrics, we identify a significant decline (increase) in the CEO effect on accounting-based (market-based) performance measures (measure) from the pre-crisis to the crisis period, followed by a significant rebound post-crisis. We replicate the analysis using a sample of Chinese firms and find a consistent pattern. Our research advances the CEO effect literature by emphasizing the dynamic nature of the CEO effect in an international context. Our findings highlight that the CEO effect is not static but can undergo short-term fluctuations due to significant changes in the macroeconomic environment.\n",

      "Abstract: In a bid to improve entrepreneurial outcomes of graduates from Nigerian universities, the Nigerian government has launched a range of interventions, including a 2004 national policy mandating compulsory inclusion of entrepreneurship education in the curriculum, and support for the establishment and implementation of entrepreneurship development activities by university departments. However, not much is known about the operational nuances, challenges and impact cases that characterise the implementation of this national policy in such a vast, culturally diverse country as Nigeria. To address this lacuna, this study draws on qualitative data from five focus groups, crystalised with quantitative data from 151 students across four Nigerian Universities, to explicate the current trends, successes, and challenges of entrepreneurship development and innovation support in Nigerian universities. The paper offers recommendations on how the current policy on entrepreneurship education in Nigeria can be enhanced to improve student entrepreneurial aspirations and outcomes. It also signposts innovative pedagogic activities which could be deployed to achieve this.\n",

      "Abstract: Drawing on Oliver’s typology of strategic responses (1991), this study demonstrates the strategic pressures that vulnerable local communities in Nigeria have exerted on cement companies and the multiple strategies that these companies have devised to discharge their environmental and social accountability (ESA). The data for this study were obtained through semi-structured interviews and document analysis. By exploring the role of local communities in Nigeria, our findings highlight the changing context of ESA in emerging economies in which local communities, often referred to as weak and passive stakeholders, have forced multinational companies to respond to their commitment to ESA. However, the extent to which local communities’ voices can alter companies’ profit maximisation that compromises people’s welfare and the environment has caused concern. The power and influence wielded by companies, which has enabled them to devise a multitude of strategic responses, has subtly dominated local voices and actions, confining ESA practices largely to the content of their annual statements. This raises concerns about current mechanisms for discharging ESA to promote sustainable development and attain sustainable development goals (SDGs) in emerging economies. In investigating the aforementioned, the paper also addresses the call made by prior work delineating the nexus between corporations and local communities in shaping ESA in the unique contexts of emerging economies.\n",

      "Abstract: The study examines the impact of board committee indexes on the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure, and accounting- and market-based performance measures of multinational enterprises (MNEs). Using quantile regression analysis and a large balanced panel data of 500 multinational companies operating in 40 countries from 2009 to 2019 (i.e., 5,500 firm-year observations), we uncovered the following significant associations: (i) a positive relationship between ESG disclosure and accounting performance indicators for large-sized MNEs, but this relationship is counteracted by the negative influence of the audit and sustainability committee indexes; (ii) the association between market-based performance outcomes and ESG disclosure is positively affected by the compensation, nomination, and sustainability committee indexes, while it is negatively influenced by the audit committee index; (iii) the combined board committee index has varying impacts on the connection between the components of ESG disclosure, and accounting and market-relevant performance metrics for different sizes of MNEs; and (iv) while the audit and sustainability committee indexes exert negative effects on the relationship between the components of ESG disclosure and performance measures, these effects are countered by the positive moderating impacts of the compensation and nomination committee indexes. The study concludes by discussing the policy implications of these results.\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: This study examines the relationship between Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices and financial distress in times of uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: Thomson Reuters ESG database, Compustat and Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) were used to derive a final sample size of 1,572 firms and 11,618 firm-year observations from 2003 to 2022. Fixed-effects regression was used to analyze the data. Findings: It was found that increasing ESG involvement leads to an increase in Z score (i.e. lower financial distress), and this impact was more profound during the COVID-19 period and also when firms' innovativeness increased. However, during the COVID-19 period, increases in capital expenditures weaken the positive effect of ESG on financial distress. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the growing body of literature on the impact of ESG performance on financial distress and the nature of this relationship during times of uncertainty such as COVID-19. Practical implications: This study offers insights to managers and practitioners when developing their corporate financial strategies, particularly financial distress management, showing the potential benefits of innovativeness and capital intensity during turbulent times similar to COVID-19. Originality/value: Little knowledge exists on how ESG engagement helps weather financial distress during periods of uncertainty due to external shocks (e.g. COVID-19). This paper looks at the effect of ESG engagement on financial distress and how capital intensity and innovativeness could influence this relationship while giving fresh insights into the impact of COVID-19.\n",

      "Abstract: The development of smartphones and mobile internet technologies has promoted the development of mobile payments worldwide. The core purpose of this study is to ascertain what the main factors are which affect Dutch customers’ adoption and experience of mobile payments. This study first addresses the concepts of mobile payments and customer experience and then explores the current Dutch financial and banking systems, before attempting to understand the recent researches worldwide on mobile payments. Based on quantitative research methods, the study examines the factors that influence the adoption and experience of mobile payments and the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on payment methods due to social distancing rules in the Netherlands. It finds that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, safety and trust are the main factors that affect the adoption of mobile payments, and mobile-payment providers need to improve technical protection and offer some benefits to boost the mobile-payment business. The COVID-19 outbreak has caused the decline of cash payments and the increase of contactless payments in the Netherlands; mobile payments ensure people’s health and help slow down the spread of the virus.\n",

      "Abstract: The packaging industry's significant role in plastic production and environmental pollution underscores the need for more sustainable alternatives. Bioplastics emerge as a promising solution, yet consumer understanding of this innovative material often lags, particularly in emerging markets. This study thus aims to explore effective marketing strategies for communicating bioplastic packaging to shape consumer adoption and disposal practices in such markets. Through a case study approach, we examine the role of ecolabels as a marketing tool across key sectors of the bioplastic packaging supply chain. Drawing upon the signalling theory, we identify key characteristics of effective signals, including costly signalling, visibility, clarity, fitness, consistency, and credibility, which should be integrated into a broader context of ecolabels design in order to encourage consumer adoption and responsible disposal. Our study also identifies instances where noises from the environment may have little impact and where communication gaps hinder feedback loops between consumers and producers.\n",

      "Abstract: We examine how arms imports reductions due to external arms embargoes affect military expenditure, democratic quality and internal conflict in a sample of 48 countries from 1990 to 2017. We construct a theoretical model of arms restrictions influencing probabilities of peaceful and conflictual states via actions and efforts undertaken by the government and rebels to promote peace. We postulate that the effect of external arms embargoes on internal conflict is conditional, requiring empirical investigation. Our empirical analysis, based on the Panel Vector Autoregressive methods, reveals that the responses of political system and different indices of democracy to decreases in arms imports are positive, and the impact on military expenditures is negative, while the responses of education expenditures, health expenditures are positive. Despite this, our findings show that arms transfer restrictions can intensify ethnic tensions and internal conflicts.\n",
